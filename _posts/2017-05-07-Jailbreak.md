jailbreak fans were expecting to receive the jailbreak tool for the iOS 10.3.1 right after Apple released the iOS 10.3.2. However, fans are complaining that the product is not being released by PanGu, despite the fact that the team of hackers made it public that they have been working on such a tool for the 10.3.1 version of the iOS.

We should still expect the jailbreak tool for the iOS 10.3.1 sometime after August. Adam Donenfeld, who works at Zimpreium (a mobile security company) discussed the exploit for iOS 10.3.1 that can also work for iOS 10.2, according to a recent report issued by 1 Red Drop.

**### Update**

the Pangu team will indeed be releasing the iOS 10.3.1 jailbreak at one point this summer. The entire jailbreak community claims that we will be receiving it by August. 


At the same time, while PanGu is delaying the release, it seems that ## Luca Todesco is undergoing some fruitful work with his Yalu jailbreak tool for the iOS 10. This is compatible with the iOS 10.1, 10.1.1 and even 10.2. However, this tool only works with the 64-bit iPhones before iPhone 7.

What about the iPhone 7?

The Yalu iOS 10 jailbreak can work on the iPhone 7 too, but keep in mind that it can only work with iOS 10.1 and 10.1.1. According to Todesco, he is not planning to release support for the iOS 10.3.3 with the jailbreak tool. This decision comes after he thought it was time for him to quit the industry. Needless to say, many people are sorry to hear this, but unfortunately he said he cannot go on forever.

Apple is trying their best to make sure there are no loopholes in their OS.
